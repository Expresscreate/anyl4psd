As part of the project, several sportive activities (football, danse, basketball) have been organised involving several categories of children as minor inmates; refugees, internally displaced children; and children in areas affected by community conflict. Participants have been sensitized against hate speech and the importance of the living together. All through the projects, several advocacies have been raised towards governments and local authorities for the respect of UN Convention on Child Rights, Convention against Elimination of Discrimination against Women, UNSCR 1325 and 2250.<\/div>","excerpt":"","slug":"september-december-2017-sport-for-peace","image":{"url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace.jpg","id":351,"extension":"jpg","width":1080,"height":810,"sizes":{"thumbnail":{"width":150,"height":150,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace-150x150.jpg"},"medium":{"width":300,"height":225,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace-300x225.jpg"},"medium_large":{"width":768,"height":576,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace-768x576.jpg"},"large":{"width":1024,"height":768,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace-1024x768.jpg"},"neve-blog":{"width":930,"height":620,"mime-type":"image\/jpeg","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Standing-Up-for-Peace-930x620.jpg"}}},"all_day":true,"start_date":"2017-09-01 00:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"09","day":"01","hour":"00","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2017-12-01 23:59:59","end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"01","hour":"23","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"utc_start_date":"2017-08-31 23:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"08","day":"31","hour":"23","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2017-12-01 22:59:59","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2017","month":"12","day":"01","hour":"22","minutes":"59","seconds":"59"},"timezone":"UTC+1","timezone_abbr":"UTC+1","cost":"Gratuit","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":["0"]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":false,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"events","slug":"events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":13,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":16,"filter":"raw","id":13,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/13","collection":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"SEPTEMBER \u2013 DECEMBER 2017: SPORT FOR PEACE","description":"&lt;p&gt;This project aimed at using sport as a tool to prevent violent extremism (PVE) and enhancing peacebuilding in communities.
