Consequently, one of the reasons for employing child soldiers is that \u201cthey are viewed as expendable, replaceable\u201d \u2013 and they are cheap to maintain. They are also psychologically more vulnerable than many adults, who already have a more shaped personality. Since younger children, in particular, can lack a sense of fear, they might be preferred over adults because they accept more dangerous tasks without scrutinising them. Children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 identities are still being formed, meaning that they can be more easily influenced and controlled, since they are dependent on protection and guidance.<\/p>\n<p>A total of 54 percent of the children reports having killed someone, and 28 percent reports that they were forced to engage in sexual contact. 35 percent of the interviewed children had developed a fully developed posttraumatic stress disorder, a debilitating mental health disorder<\/p>\n<p>According to the study, The most common traumatic life events of those who had been abducted were: forced to skin, chop or cook dead bodies (8%), forced to eat human flesh (8%), forced to loot property and burn houses (48%), forced to abduct other children (30%), forced to kill someone (36%), forced to beat, injure or mutilate someone (38%), causing serious injury or death to somebody else (44%), severe human suffering, such as carrying heavy loads or being deprived of food (100%), given birth to a child in captivity (33% of girls), threatened to be killed (93%), seeing people with mutilations and dead bodies (78%), sexual assault (45%), assault with a weapon (77%) and physical assault including kicked, beaten, burnt (90%).<\/p>\n<\/div>","excerpt":"","slug":"july-october-2019-study-child-soldiers-in-central-africa","image":false,"all_day":false,"start_date":"2019-07-01 08:00:00","start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"07","day":"01","hour":"08","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"end_date":"2019-10-07 18:00:00","end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"07","hour":"18","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_start_date":"2019-07-01 07:00:00","utc_start_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"07","day":"01","hour":"07","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"utc_end_date":"2019-10-07 17:00:00","utc_end_date_details":{"year":"2019","month":"10","day":"07","hour":"17","minutes":"00","seconds":"00"},"timezone":"UTC+1","timezone_abbr":"UTC+1","cost":"Gratuit","cost_details":{"currency_symbol":"","currency_code":"","currency_position":"prefix","values":["0"]},"website":"","show_map":false,"show_map_link":false,"hide_from_listings":false,"sticky":false,"featured":false,"categories":[{"name":"events","slug":"events","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":13,"taxonomy":"tribe_events_cat","description":"","parent":0,"count":16,"filter":"raw","id":13,"urls":{"self":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories\/13","collection":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/wp-json\/tribe\/events\/v1\/categories"}}],"tags":[],"venue":[],"organizer":[],"json_ld":{"@context":"http:\/\/schema.org","@type":"Event","name":"JULY \u2013 OCTOBER 2019: STUDY, CHILD SOLDIERS IN CENTRAL AFRICA","description":"&lt;p&gt;Study, Child soldiers in Central Africa: from children for war to children for\u00a0Silence the Guns is an integrated project which ambitions to contribute to address the causes and the consequences&hellip;&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/event\/july-october-2019-study-child-soldiers-in-central-africa\/&quot; class=&quot;&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;Lire la suite &raquo;&lt;span class=&quot;screen-reader-text&quot;&gt;JULY \u2013 OCTOBER 2019: STUDY, CHILD SOLDIERS IN CENTRAL AFRICA&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/a&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\\n","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/event\/july-october-2019-study-child-soldiers-in-central-africa\/","eventAttendanceMode":"https:\/\/schema.org\/OfflineEventAttendanceMode","eventStatus":"https:\/\/schema.org\/EventScheduled","startDate":"2019-07-01T08:00:00+01:00","endDate":"2019-10-07T18:00:00+01:00","offers":{"@type":"Offer","price":"0","priceCurrency":"USD","url":"https:\/\/children4peacec4p.org\/event\/july-october-2019-study-child-soldiers-in-central-africa\/","category":"primary","availability":"inStock","validFrom":"1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"},"performer":"Organization"}}
