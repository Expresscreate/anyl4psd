The idea of activities and projects driven cartoons was justified by the concern to address language barrier which are an issue when it comes to spreading peace in Cameroon, central and west Africa that are home to a diverse mix of cultures, languages and dialects. As part of this project, dozens of frameworks where children have been initiated to art work have been created in several communities. Through the stories of ex-child soldiers, boys and girls who were recruited by extremist groups, have experienced\/testified abuse to kids\u2019 rights, the project contributed to the design, production and distribution of cartoons explaining the consequences of radicalisation, the stakes and challenges of peacebuilding, the horrors of violent extremism and early\/wrought marriage on girls. It has contributed to improve children and community understanding and awareness on countering, preventing and fighting violent extremism (PVCE), the phenomenon of child soldiers, girls\u2019 early marriage and sexual abuses during conflictual and post conflictual periods. It has contributed to democratize public sphere for more political and economic expression of children that are integrating the values of inclusivity and participation while engaging directly with traditional and religious beliefs of those experiencing violent conflict.<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The project Art for Peace aimed at contributing to fight against radicalisation.
