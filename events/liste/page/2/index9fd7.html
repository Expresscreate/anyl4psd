SUMMARY:JULY – OCTOBER 2019: STUDY\, CHILD SOLDIERS IN CENTRAL AFRICA
DESCRIPTION:Study\, Child soldiers in Central Africa: from children for war to children for Silence the Guns is an integrated project which ambitions to contribute to address the causes and the consequences of violent extremism/terrorism and illicit proliferation of weapons \nThis study was implemented from July to October 2019 in the East\, the far north and the Anglophone part of Cameroon and targets 25 groups of 50 children from Nigeria\, Chad\, CAR\, Angola\, DRC and Cameroon made of children refugees\, children who have belonged to armed groups and former bomb-carrying children radicalised by boko haram:  The average age of the target group is 17 years old. \nOne of the first observation of that study demonstrates\, that more than 50% of the population in Nigeria\, Chad\, CAR\, Angola\, DRC and Cameroon conflict or post-conflict zones consists of children younger than 18 years old. Consequently\, one of the reasons for employing child soldiers is that “they are viewed as expendable\, replaceable” – and they are cheap to maintain. They are also psychologically more vulnerable than many adults\, who already have a more shaped personality. Since younger children\, in particular\, can lack a sense of fear\, they might be preferred over adults because they accept more dangerous tasks without scrutinising them. Children’s and adolescents’ identities are still being formed\, meaning that they can be more easily influenced and controlled\, since they are dependent on protection and guidance. \nA total of 54 percent of the children reports having killed someone\, and 28 percent reports that they were forced to engage in sexual contact. 35 percent of the interviewed children had developed a fully developed posttraumatic stress disorder\, a debilitating mental health disorder \nAccording to the study\, The most common traumatic life events of those who had been abducted were: forced to skin\, chop or cook dead bodies (8%)\, forced to eat human flesh (8%)\, forced to loot property and burn houses (48%)\, forced to abduct other children (30%)\, forced to kill someone (36%)\, forced to beat\, injure or mutilate someone (38%)\, causing serious injury or death to somebody else (44%)\, severe human suffering\, such as carrying heavy loads or being deprived of food (100%)\, given birth to a child in captivity (33% of girls)\, threatened to be killed (93%)\, seeing people with mutilations and dead bodies (78%)\, sexual assault (45%)\, assault with a weapon (77%) and physical assault including kicked\, beaten\, burnt (90%).

SUMMARY:SEPTEMBER 2016 – MARCH 2017: ART FOR PEACE PROJECT
DESCRIPTION:The project Art for Peace aimed at contributing to fight against radicalisation. The idea of activities and projects driven cartoons was justified by the concern to address language barrier which are an issue when it comes to spreading peace in Cameroon\, central and west Africa that are home to a diverse mix of cultures\, languages and dialects. As part of this project\, dozens of frameworks where children have been initiated to art work have been created in several communities. Through the stories of ex-child soldiers\, boys and girls who were recruited by extremist groups\, have experienced/testified abuse to kids’ rights\, the project contributed to the design\, production and distribution of cartoons explaining the consequences of radicalisation\, the stakes and challenges of peacebuilding\, the horrors of violent extremism and early/wrought marriage on girls. It has contributed to improve children and community understanding and awareness on countering\, preventing and fighting violent extremism (PVCE)\, the phenomenon of child soldiers\, girls’ early marriage and sexual abuses during conflictual and post conflictual periods. It has contributed to democratize public sphere for more political and economic expression of children that are integrating the values of inclusivity and participation while engaging directly with traditional and religious beliefs of those experiencing violent conflict.

SUMMARY:JANUARY – MAY 2016: INTER COMMUNITY CHILDREN PEACE CAMP AND THE INTERCOMMUNITY PEACE CAMP
DESCRIPTION:This Project was implemented in the communities of Guiziga and Laka in Far North Cameroon. The Inter Community Peace Camp idea aims to resolve conflict between tribes or community by developing friendships between their children and building on this to resolve interethnic conflict\, land conflict\, religious conflict and promote social – economic interdependence. Communities in conflicts were Laka and Fullani on one hand and on another hand the Guizigas and Fullani. The object of conflicts was the destruction of Guiziga and Laka crops by the cattle of Fulani.The project paired communities and families in conflict by using children as vectors of peacebuilding and unification of their conflictual families. As part of the project\, children and families’ capacities have been built in peacebuilding and their role to end the conflicts. The project has yielded several advocacies and meetings through the facilitation of children\, traditional and religious leaders. The final goal of this advocacy was the restoration of peace between those communities through the organization of an Inter Community Peace Camp to strengthen the communion between the ex-conflictual families through family homestay visits; exchange of gifts. The Intercommunity children Peace Camp ended up with some resolutions and recommendations to follow by all the communities.
