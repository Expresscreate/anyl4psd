SUMMARY:SEPTEMBER 2016 – MARCH 2017: ART FOR PEACE PROJECT
DESCRIPTION:The project Art for Peace aimed at contributing to fight against radicalisation. The idea of activities and projects driven cartoons was justified by the concern to address language barrier which are an issue when it comes to spreading peace in Cameroon\, central and west Africa that are home to a diverse mix of cultures\, languages and dialects. As part of this project\, dozens of frameworks where children have been initiated to art work have been created in several communities. Through the stories of ex-child soldiers\, boys and girls who were recruited by extremist groups\, have experienced/testified abuse to kids’ rights\, the project contributed to the design\, production and distribution of cartoons explaining the consequences of radicalisation\, the stakes and challenges of peacebuilding\, the horrors of violent extremism and early/wrought marriage on girls. It has contributed to improve children and community understanding and awareness on countering\, preventing and fighting violent extremism (PVCE)\, the phenomenon of child soldiers\, girls’ early marriage and sexual abuses during conflictual and post conflictual periods. It has contributed to democratize public sphere for more political and economic expression of children that are integrating the values of inclusivity and participation while engaging directly with traditional and religious beliefs of those experiencing violent conflict.

SUMMARY:JANUARY – MAY 2016: INTER COMMUNITY CHILDREN PEACE CAMP AND THE INTERCOMMUNITY PEACE CAMP
DESCRIPTION:This Project was implemented in the communities of Guiziga and Laka in Far North Cameroon. The Inter Community Peace Camp idea aims to resolve conflict between tribes or community by developing friendships between their children and building on this to resolve interethnic conflict\, land conflict\, religious conflict and promote social – economic interdependence. Communities in conflicts were Laka and Fullani on one hand and on another hand the Guizigas and Fullani. The object of conflicts was the destruction of Guiziga and Laka crops by the cattle of Fulani.The project paired communities and families in conflict by using children as vectors of peacebuilding and unification of their conflictual families. As part of the project\, children and families’ capacities have been built in peacebuilding and their role to end the conflicts. The project has yielded several advocacies and meetings through the facilitation of children\, traditional and religious leaders. The final goal of this advocacy was the restoration of peace between those communities through the organization of an Inter Community Peace Camp to strengthen the communion between the ex-conflictual families through family homestay visits; exchange of gifts. The Intercommunity children Peace Camp ended up with some resolutions and recommendations to follow by all the communities.
