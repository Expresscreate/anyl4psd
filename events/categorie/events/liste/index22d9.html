SUMMARY:Project SILENCE THE GUNS
DESCRIPTION:1.0 Problem Statement and justification  \nOver the past two decades\, the threat posed by violent extremist groups has grown substantially across Africa. As many African countries\, Cameroon\, situated in the Lake Chad Basin and the Gulf of Guinea\, faces since several years\, significant issues of unrest and insecurity\, including the increasing number of refugees coming from the Central African crisis.  The presence and operations of Boko Haram have displaced over 1.2 million people internally and forced more than 200\,000 Nigerians to flee to Cameroon Chad and Niger. Internal displacement often feeds into and exacerbates pre-existing conflicts and dynamics of displacement amongst pastoralists and sedentary communities – not least since Boko Haram implements a strategy of stealing livestock and burning farmlands in rural communities. \nThe ongoing conflict with Boko Haram\, operating in the Far North region since 2014 has so far made at least 2\,500 killed\, 250\,000 displaced and is triggering the rise of vigilante self-defense groups. In 2016\, separatist rebels launched in the north-West and South-West Cameroon a battle for their own state making over 3 000 killings (civilians and army)\, and forced more than 700\,000 people out from their homes\, thousands fleeing across the border into Nigeria. Conflicts have been causing a great toll on the situation of the Child rights\, since thousands of children have been involved as combatants\, mine testers\, messengers and cooks some of them\, used as human shields or as sex slaves for military leaders. \nIn this context of security crises\, the outbreak of COVID-19 added in the country a health crisis\, impacting progress in the fight against poverty and for children rights; decreasing school enrollment rate\, increasing early marriages and illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons.  Coupled with the (impacts of the COVID19 pandemic)\, conflicts and violent extremism are undeniably one of the biggest impediments to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child\, the convention of elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the implementation of the agenda 2063 of Africa Union. One important cause and consequence of the cycle of conflicts in Cameroon and in Africa is the proliferation of small arms and light weapons by civilians\, including rebel groups and militias as well as government-related entities. Guns which have been becoming the most popular weapon are mostly imported and cause more deaths than bombs\, grenades or mines (according to the 2019 SAS and African Union study\, Weapons Compass: Mapping Illicit Small Arms Flows in Africa). \nIt is commonly admitted that children are the future and that they are the main victims of conflicts and violent extremism since they deprive them from their rights and endanger their future. However\, they are generally forgotten and left behind when talking about serious issues concerning their lives and future. In order to address this situation\, Children for Peace implements the project “Silence the Guns”. \n  \n2.0 Objectives of the intervention  \n2.1 Overarching Objective  \nSilence The Guns is an integrated citizen engagement project led by Children and especially girls whose overall objective is to contribute to realize a conflict free Africa by engaging children to mobilise all stakeholders to prioritize efforts on peace\, children and girls rights\, effective socio-economic development. \n2.2 Specific objectives \n\nposition children as core actors of peacebuilding and fight against the pandemic in their community;\n\nStrengthen children and community capacities on topics related to the fight against hate speech\, peacebuilding\, violent extremism and human rights focusing on children rights\, disarmament and illicit proliferation of weapons; \n\n\nMentor and engage children to develop and implement community initiatives related to peacebuilding\, children rights\, countering violent extremism\, fight against hate speech and illicit proliferation of weapons\, \n\n\nOperationalize community awareness and advocacy campaign on the topic Silencing the Guns to support the global ceasefire call of the UNSG; \n\nPromote/valorize children’s peacebuilding best practices as part of the project Silence the Guns.\n\n  \n4.0 Place and date \nThis second part of the project Silence the Guns (whose first part was achieved in 2020) will be implemented during 5 months from February to June 2022 in Cameroon. \n  \n5.0 Target group   \nThe project will mobilize children and youths (7- 18 years old) from schools\, university\, mosques\, churches faith-based organizations (including refugees and IDPs). \n  \nKey activities  \n\n\nPress conference with livestream on Children for Peace Facebook page on February 10th\, 2022. https://www.facebook.com/Children-for-Peace-C4P-997762983708894 \n\nBuild directly the capacity children’s trainers of trainers on themes related to the fight against Hate speech\, peacebuilding\, violent extremism and human rights focusing on children rights\, disarmament and illicit proliferation of weapons.\nSupport Children to elaborate children declaration on “Ceasefire – Silence the Guns” and make it endorsed by children across the country.\nOrganize Art for peace sessions within Children for Peace Art for Peace training programme to build the capacity of children to produce paintings/artworks telling their stories on Hate speech\, peacebuilding\, disarmament and non-violence.\nSet up children for Peace clubs in communities and build the capacity of members in leadership for peacebuilding\, human/children rights\, and gender-equity.\nOrganize a children’s march for peace entitled “Ceasefire – Silence the Guns”\nOrganize sensitization and advocacy meetings with local traditional and religious authorities; State officials\, private sector on matters related to peacebuilding\, disarmament\, reintegration\, girls and children rights.\nSet up of 3 peacebuilding multi-stakeholders networks constituted by 75 religious\, traditional leaders and state officials)\, 200 community members and 500 children 19 – 28 February 2022\nSet up and engage several peacebuilding multi-stakeholders’ networks in the drafting and implementation of community roadmap to fight violent extremis and illicit proliferation of weapons in communities.\nTake advantage of social media and local media to increase girls and children voice for peace through various communication tools and channels.\n\nExpected impacts   \n The ultimate outcome expected from this project is as follows a conflict-free country and continent\, rid of wars\, civil conflicts\, human rights violations\, humanitarian disasters\, genocide\, violent extremism and conflicts thanks to multi-stakeholders ’collaboration and synergies and the crucial role of children and youth. \nThrough the project: \n\n\nchildren\, religious and traditional leaders; community leaders and local authorities will work closely together (1) against hate speech and identity-based differences; mobilizing them in community-based activities to find gender sensitive approaches to dealing both with conflict\, gender based violence and early/wrought marriages in their communities (2) to advance the Silence the guns project related issues; to counter violent speech\, illicit proliferation of weapons and to identify early-warning initiatives in communities. \n\nStigmatization of disengaged children/teenagers ex-combatants will be lowered and communities more ready to accept them.\n\nLocal governance of prevention and resolution of conflicts control of illicit proliferation of small arms and light weapons will be reshaped with children as key actors. \n\n\n  \nFor the implementation of this project\, Children for Peace will be partnering and working on the field with local authorities\, religious\, traditional leaders\, several local associations and networks for the achievement of the project’s goals.

SUMMARY:JULY – OCTOBER 2019: STUDY\, CHILD SOLDIERS IN CENTRAL AFRICA
DESCRIPTION:Study\, Child soldiers in Central Africa: from children for war to children for Silence the Guns is an integrated project which ambitions to contribute to address the causes and the consequences of violent extremism/terrorism and illicit proliferation of weapons \nThis study was implemented from July to October 2019 in the East\, the far north and the Anglophone part of Cameroon and targets 25 groups of 50 children from Nigeria\, Chad\, CAR\, Angola\, DRC and Cameroon made of children refugees\, children who have belonged to armed groups and former bomb-carrying children radicalised by boko haram:  The average age of the target group is 17 years old. \nOne of the first observation of that study demonstrates\, that more than 50% of the population in Nigeria\, Chad\, CAR\, Angola\, DRC and Cameroon conflict or post-conflict zones consists of children younger than 18 years old. Consequently\, one of the reasons for employing child soldiers is that “they are viewed as expendable\, replaceable” – and they are cheap to maintain. They are also psychologically more vulnerable than many adults\, who already have a more shaped personality. Since younger children\, in particular\, can lack a sense of fear\, they might be preferred over adults because they accept more dangerous tasks without scrutinising them. Children’s and adolescents’ identities are still being formed\, meaning that they can be more easily influenced and controlled\, since they are dependent on protection and guidance. \nA total of 54 percent of the children reports having killed someone\, and 28 percent reports that they were forced to engage in sexual contact. 35 percent of the interviewed children had developed a fully developed posttraumatic stress disorder\, a debilitating mental health disorder \nAccording to the study\, The most common traumatic life events of those who had been abducted were: forced to skin\, chop or cook dead bodies (8%)\, forced to eat human flesh (8%)\, forced to loot property and burn houses (48%)\, forced to abduct other children (30%)\, forced to kill someone (36%)\, forced to beat\, injure or mutilate someone (38%)\, causing serious injury or death to somebody else (44%)\, severe human suffering\, such as carrying heavy loads or being deprived of food (100%)\, given birth to a child in captivity (33% of girls)\, threatened to be killed (93%)\, seeing people with mutilations and dead bodies (78%)\, sexual assault (45%)\, assault with a weapon (77%) and physical assault including kicked\, beaten\, burnt (90%).

SUMMARY:SEPTEMBER 2016 – MARCH 2017: ART FOR PEACE PROJECT
DESCRIPTION:The project Art for Peace aimed at contributing to fight against radicalisation. The idea of activities and projects driven cartoons was justified by the concern to address language barrier which are an issue when it comes to spreading peace in Cameroon\, central and west Africa that are home to a diverse mix of cultures\, languages and dialects. As part of this project\, dozens of frameworks where children have been initiated to art work have been created in several communities. Through the stories of ex-child soldiers\, boys and girls who were recruited by extremist groups\, have experienced/testified abuse to kids’ rights\, the project contributed to the design\, production and distribution of cartoons explaining the consequences of radicalisation\, the stakes and challenges of peacebuilding\, the horrors of violent extremism and early/wrought marriage on girls. It has contributed to improve children and community understanding and awareness on countering\, preventing and fighting violent extremism (PVCE)\, the phenomenon of child soldiers\, girls’ early marriage and sexual abuses during conflictual and post conflictual periods. It has contributed to democratize public sphere for more political and economic expression of children that are integrating the values of inclusivity and participation while engaging directly with traditional and religious beliefs of those experiencing violent conflict.

SUMMARY:JANUARY – MAY 2016: INTER COMMUNITY CHILDREN PEACE CAMP AND THE INTERCOMMUNITY PEACE CAMP
DESCRIPTION:This Project was implemented in the communities of Guiziga and Laka in Far North Cameroon. The Inter Community Peace Camp idea aims to resolve conflict between tribes or community by developing friendships between their children and building on this to resolve interethnic conflict\, land conflict\, religious conflict and promote social – economic interdependence. Communities in conflicts were Laka and Fullani on one hand and on another hand the Guizigas and Fullani. The object of conflicts was the destruction of Guiziga and Laka crops by the cattle of Fulani.The project paired communities and families in conflict by using children as vectors of peacebuilding and unification of their conflictual families. As part of the project\, children and families’ capacities have been built in peacebuilding and their role to end the conflicts. The project has yielded several advocacies and meetings through the facilitation of children\, traditional and religious leaders. The final goal of this advocacy was the restoration of peace between those communities through the organization of an Inter Community Peace Camp to strengthen the communion between the ex-conflictual families through family homestay visits; exchange of gifts. The Intercommunity children Peace Camp ended up with some resolutions and recommendations to follow by all the communities.
