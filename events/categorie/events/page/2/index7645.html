SUMMARY:JANUARY – MAY 2016: INTER COMMUNITY CHILDREN PEACE CAMP AND THE INTERCOMMUNITY PEACE CAMP
DESCRIPTION:This Project was implemented in the communities of Guiziga and Laka in Far North Cameroon. The Inter Community Peace Camp idea aims to resolve conflict between tribes or community by developing friendships between their children and building on this to resolve interethnic conflict\, land conflict\, religious conflict and promote social – economic interdependence. Communities in conflicts were Laka and Fullani on one hand and on another hand the Guizigas and Fullani. The object of conflicts was the destruction of Guiziga and Laka crops by the cattle of Fulani.The project paired communities and families in conflict by using children as vectors of peacebuilding and unification of their conflictual families. As part of the project\, children and families’ capacities have been built in peacebuilding and their role to end the conflicts. The project has yielded several advocacies and meetings through the facilitation of children\, traditional and religious leaders. The final goal of this advocacy was the restoration of peace between those communities through the organization of an Inter Community Peace Camp to strengthen the communion between the ex-conflictual families through family homestay visits; exchange of gifts. The Intercommunity children Peace Camp ended up with some resolutions and recommendations to follow by all the communities.
